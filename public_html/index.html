<center> <h3>About Me</h3></center>
<p>Greetings, my name is Khizrali Kradiya and I go to <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M<a/>. I am currently a sophomore at Mays Business School and I am from <a href="https://www.sanantonio.gov/">San Antonio</a>. The process of making this website was very exciting because I got to use Visual Studio Code on my Mac to be able to showcase my knowledge of HTML. </p>

<p>I plan to graduate in December 2025 with my <i>Management Information Systems</i> degree as well as a minor in Cybersecurity. I really love Cybersecurity and the path the field is taking right now, I really see a immediate growing future with technology and can't wait to be part of it. When I graduate, I want to become a consultant/tech consultant, so I can be able to help companies with solving any technical or non technical problems that will help them operate more efficiently. So far during my time at Texas A&M, I have taken Fundamentals of Information Systems my freshman year which introduced me to the basic concepts of the MIS field. As a sophomore, I am taking Business Programming Logic and Design, which has introduced me to the concept of C# and Visual Studios Basic. In my Programming class, I really got a grasp on different coding techniques and the logical thinking behind it. </p>
